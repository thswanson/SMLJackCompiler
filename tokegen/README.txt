I managed to achieve everything to the end of the Good case, meaning I finished compiling complex arrays. I also went back and tested everything for backward compatibility meaning I was able to go back and run average, pong, complex arrays, square dance, binary conversion, and seven after slight tweaks. Everything should now be up and running with almost perfect precision. 

To run the program first make the file like you would any SML file. Then you should type calc and then press enter. That will prompt an empty line in your terminal / command prompt. Then you should enter the name of the jack file that you want compiled. Press enter and you should see a wall of text. That wall of text includes tokens and bindings printed for debugging sakes. You can ignore unless you are interested. The machine code that was outputted will exist in a file called Main.vm. That should be all you need to know about how to run the code.
